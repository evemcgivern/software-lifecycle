Check a software inventory for products past or near end of life and for vendors and products listed in CISA KEV, offline and read-only. Use for an end-of-life review, before a patching or upgrade budget request, or when preparing for an audit.

This is a skeleton. The full README is added in later tasks.

## Install

<!-- install:begin -->
Pick your platform. Steps expand below. The [Install section of the collection README](../../../../README.md#install) has the full guide.

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code (terminal CLI)</b> — recommended</summary>

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add evemcgivern/agent-skills
claude plugin install app-governance-kit@evemcgivern-skills
```

This installs the whole `app-governance-kit` plugin, so you also get its other skills: `access-review`, `ai-intake`, `app-governance`, `cert-prep`, `crosswalk`, `hardware-lifecycle`, `itam-maturity`, `program-setup`, `rationalization`. Run it as `/app-governance-kit:software-lifecycle`. Inside a session, the same thing is `/plugin marketplace add evemcgivern/agent-skills`, then `/plugin install app-governance-kit@evemcgivern-skills`.

Update later with `claude plugin marketplace update evemcgivern-skills`, then `claude plugin update app-governance-kit@evemcgivern-skills`.

To install only this skill, copy it from a clone of the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evemcgivern/agent-skills.git && cd agent-skills
scripts/install.sh software-lifecycle   # into ~/.claude/skills/software-lifecycle
```

Add `--project <repo-path>` for one repository only, or `--force` to replace a copy you already have.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code desktop app</b></summary>

In a local Code session choose **+ → Plugins → Add plugin**, enter `evemcgivern/agent-skills` as the marketplace, then install **app-governance-kit** (it brings the plugin's other skills too).

Local desktop and CLI sessions share user-scope installs. Cloud Code sessions do not load local plugins; commit this skill folder to your repository's `.claude/skills/software-lifecycle/` instead.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex (CLI, IDE extension, desktop app)</b></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evemcgivern/agent-skills.git && cd agent-skills
scripts/install.sh --target codex software-lifecycle   # into ~/.agents/skills/software-lifecycle
```

Add `--project <repo-path>` to install into that repository's `.agents/skills/software-lifecycle/` instead. Or copy this folder by hand to `~/.agents/skills/software-lifecycle/`, or `.agents/skills/software-lifecycle/` in a repository; keep every file in it together. Start a new session and invoke the skill by name. See the [Codex skills docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills-and-plugins).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Other agents: Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, OpenCode, Cline</b> — works with a limit</summary>

These agents load `SKILL.md` folders directly. Copy this whole folder to the place your agent reads:

- Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode: `~/.agents/skills/software-lifecycle/` for personal use (`scripts/install.sh --target codex software-lifecycle` does this), or `<repo>/.agents/skills/software-lifecycle/` for one repository.
- Windsurf: `<repo>/.agents/skills/software-lifecycle/`.
- Cline: `<repo>/.cline/skills/software-lifecycle/`, `<repo>/.claude/skills/software-lifecycle/` or `~/.cline/skills/software-lifecycle/`.

**Limit:** Needs a local shell and Python 3 to run the script; without them it can only read the instructions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude app (claude.ai)</b> — works with a limit</summary>

1. Zip this folder from a clone of the repo (the ZIP must contain the folder itself, with `SKILL.md` inside):
   ```bash
   cd plugins/app-governance-kit/skills && zip -r software-lifecycle.zip software-lifecycle
   ```
2. Turn on code execution under **Settings → Capabilities**.
3. Open **Customize → Skills → + → Create skill → Upload a skill** and upload `software-lifecycle.zip`.

On Enterprise, an owner must first enable skills under Organization settings. The same upload works in Claude Cowork. Local `~/.claude/skills/` files do not sync to Claude.ai, so the upload is needed; or commit the folder to a project repository's `.claude/skills/`.

**Limit:** Chat mode on synthetic data only; the script cannot run in the remote sandbox against your files.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>ChatGPT</b> — works with a limit</summary>

1. Skills in ChatGPT are in beta and available on Business, Enterprise, Edu, Teachers and Healthcare plans, not on personal Free, Plus or Pro plans. On Enterprise and Edu, a workspace admin must first turn skills on and allow skill uploading.
2. Zip this folder (the ZIP must contain the folder itself, with `SKILL.md` inside):
   ```bash
   cd plugins/app-governance-kit/skills && zip -r software-lifecycle.zip software-lifecycle
   ```
3. Open the **Plugins → Skills** tab, choose **+ → Upload from your computer** and upload the ZIP. ChatGPT scans each upload and can mark it Needs Review or Blocked.

The web and desktop apps do not sync skills. Menu labels change, so OpenAI's [Skills in ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001066-skills-in-chatgpt) article is the source of truth. ChatGPT runs skills in a remote sandbox with no access to your local files, repo or local shell. On other plans, use Codex, which reads skill folders directly.

**Limit:** Chat mode on synthetic data only; the script cannot run in the remote sandbox against your files.
